# SnapSense - Ai Photo reminder

SnapSense predicts the right moments to nudge a user to take a photo. It learns from context—time, day-part, location (Google Places types), calendar events, nearby mutual contacts, and user preferences—and outputs both a probability and a final yes/no decision. The repo includes a full training pipeline and a production-ready inference script you can run from the command line or wrap into a backend API.
